# Transforming-a-colour-image-to-cartoon-image
This Python script transforms a color image into a cartoon-style image using computer vision techniques. The transformation process involves several steps, including edge detection, color quantization, and stylization. The result is a cartoonized version of the original image, with simplified colors and bold outlines resembling a hand-drawn cartoon.

Dependencies
Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.
OpenCV: The OpenCV library is used for image processing tasks. Install it using pip install opencv-python.
numpy: This library is used for numerical computations. Install it using pip install numpy.
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Place the color image you want to transform in the same directory, or specify the path to the image in the script.
Run the script using the command python color_to_cartoon.py.
The cartoonized image will be saved in the same directory with the prefix "cartoon_" added to the original image file name.
Customization
You can customize the parameters of the transformation process, such as the size of the edge filter, the number of colors for quantization, and the strength of the stylization effect. These parameters are defined in the script and can be adjusted according to your preferences.
Experiment with different parameter values to achieve various cartoon styles and effects.
